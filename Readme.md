Hello Joanna,

My Api Project is all about listing Movies and shows using TRACK api and also listing each movies and show Soundtracks based on the movie name where the user can look up the movies and shows list, click on the "view soundtrack button and get a list of all music files related to that particular movie".
The user also has an option to search for music through a search bar just incase the specific movie or show name does not match.

It is an intergration of 2 APS's(TRAKT and Deezer) anf Tmbd api just used to access the movie and shows poster to the page.

-The TRACKT Api requires OAuth but it already has my client id and secret
-The Deezer and Tmbd Api does not require OAuth but only an access key which is already ready to use.

The Flow of the website is as follows:
1.index.php -This the main page which lists all top 20  trending movies and shows combined  of the week.
 and rest of the pages follow with clear instructions on the page itself.

For best experience, its best to signup for free deezer account just like spotify which will play music uninteruptedly
